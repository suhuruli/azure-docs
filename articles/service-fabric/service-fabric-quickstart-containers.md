# Deploy a Service Fabric Windows container application on Azure
Azure Service Fabric is a distributed systems platform for deploying and managing scalable and reliable microservices and containers. 

Running an existing application in a Windows container on a Service Fabric cluster doesn't require any changes to your application. This quickstart shows you how to deploy a pre-built Docker container image in a Service Fabric application. When you're finished, you'll have a running Windows Server 2016 Nano Server and IIS container. This quickstart describes deploying a Windows container, read [this quickstart](service-fabric-quickstart-containers-linux.md) to deploy a Linux container.

Using this quickstart you learn how to:
> [!div class="checklist"]
> * Package a Docker image container
> * Configure communication
> * Build and package the Service Fabric application
> * Deploy the container application to Azure

## Prerequisites
* An Azure subscription (you can create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F)).
* A development computer running:
  * Visual Studio 2015 or Visual Studio 2017.
  * [Service Fabric SDK and tools](service-fabric-get-started.md).

## Package a Docker image container with Visual Studio
The Service Fabric SDK and tools provide a service template to help you deploy a container to a Service Fabric cluster.

Start Visual Studio as "Administrator".  Select **File** > **New** > **Project**.

Select **Service Fabric application**, name it "MyFirstContainer", and click **OK**.

Select **Container** from the list of **service templates**.

In **Image Name**, enter "microsoft/iis:nanoserver", the [Windows Server Nano Server and IIS base image](https://hub.docker.com/r/microsoft/iis/). 

> [!NOTE]
> The base image of the container must match the host. The above will work with RS1 versions of Windows. If your cluster uses RS3, please use the "microsoft/iis:windowsservercore-1709" image for the container. 

Name your service "MyContainerService", and click **OK**.

## Configure communication and container port-to-host port mapping
The service needs an endpoint for communication.  You can now add the protocol, port, and type to an `Endpoint` in the ServiceManifest.xml file. For this quickstart, the containerized service listens on port 80: 

```xml
<Endpoint Name="MyContainerServiceTypeEndpoint" UriScheme="http" Port="80" Protocol="http"/>
```
Providing the `UriScheme` automatically registers the container endpoint with the Service Fabric Naming service for discoverability. A full ServiceManifest.xml example file is provided at the end of this article. 

Configure the container port-to-host port mapping by specifying a `PortBinding` policy in `ContainerHostPolicies` of the ApplicationManifest.xml file.  For this quickstart, `ContainerPort` is 80 and `EndpointRef` is "MyContainerServiceTypeEndpoint" (the endpoint defined in the service manifest).  Incoming requests to the service on port 80 are mapped to port 80 on the container.  

```xml
<ServiceManifestImport>
...
  <ConfigOverrides />
  <Policies>
    <ContainerHostPolicies CodePackageRef="Code">
      <PortBinding ContainerPort="80" EndpointRef="MyContainerServiceTypeEndpoint"/>
    </ContainerHostPolicies>
  </Policies>
</ServiceManifestImport>
```

A full ApplicationManifest.xml example file is provided at the end of this article.

## Create a cluster
To deploy the application to a cluster in Azure, you can either join a party cluster or [create your own cluster on Azure](service-fabric-tutorial-create-vnet-and-windows-cluster.md).

Party clusters are free, limited-time Service Fabric clusters hosted on Azure and run by the Service Fabric team where anyone can deploy applications and learn about the platform. The cluster uses a single self-signed certificate for-node-to node as well as client-to-node security. 

Sign in and [join a Windows cluster](http://aka.ms/tryservicefabric). Download the PFX certificate to your computer by clicking the **PFX** link. The certificate and the **Connection endpoint** value are used in following steps.

![PFX and connection endpoint](./media/service-fabric-quickstart-containers/party-cluster-cert.png)

On a Windows computer, install the PFX in *CurrentUser\My* certificate store.

```powershell
PS C:\mycertificates> Import-PfxCertificate -FilePath .\party-cluster-873689604-client-cert.pfx -CertStoreLocation Cert:
\CurrentUser\My


  PSParentPath: Microsoft.PowerShell.Security\Certificate::CurrentUser\My

Thumbprint                                Subject
----------                                -------
3B138D84C077C292579BA35E4410634E164075CD  CN=zwin7fh14scd.westus.cloudapp.azure.com
```

Remember the thumbprint for the following step.  

## Deploy the application to Azure using Visual Studio
Now that the application is ready, you can deploy it to a cluster directly from Visual Studio.

Right-click **MyFirstContainer** in the Solution Explorer and choose **Publish**. The Publish dialog appears.

Copy the **Connection Endpoint** from the Party cluster page into the **Connection Endpoint** field. For example, `zwin7fh14scd.westus.cloudapp.azure.com:19000`. Click **Advanced Connection Parameters** and fill in the following information.  *FindValue* and *ServerCertThumbprint* values must match the thumbprint of the certificate installed in the previous step. 

![Publish Dialog](./media/service-fabric-quickstart-containers/publish-app.png)

Click **Publish**.

Each application in the cluster must have a unique name.  Party clusters are a public, shared environment however and there may be a conflict with an existing application.  If there is a name conflict, rename the Visual Studio project and deploy again.

Open a browser and navigate to http://zwin7fh14scd.westus.cloudapp.azure.com:80. You should see the IIS default web page:
